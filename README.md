# GitHub Issue Mover

This is a small command-line tool that can move GitHub issues.

It needs a Personal Access Token from GitHub, which can be created
[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The token (probably) needs
`Full control of private repositories` (it might be enough with
`Access public repositories`, depending on the repository).

## Examples

```
$ github-issue-mover --from=https://github.com/rolfbjarne/testApp/issues/10 --to=rolfbjarne/testApp --token=<TOKEN>

```

There's also a script whose arguments are slightly faster to type (just pass
the source url and the target org/repo combo), and which reads the token from
`~/.github-status-pat`:

```
$ ./move-github-issue https://github.com/rolfbjarne/testApp/issues/10 rolfbjarne/testApp
